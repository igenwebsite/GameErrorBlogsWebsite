                        <li>Optimize Game Settings
                            <p>- Open the <strong>NVIDIA GeForce Experience</strong> app.</p>
                            <p>- Optimize the game to the lowest settings and save it.</p>
                            <p>- This step might be optional, but it’s worth trying.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Edit Game Configuration
                            <p>- Navigate to the following folder:</p>

                            <p>- Replace <strong>YourUsername</strong> with your actual Windows username.</p>
                            <p>- Alternatively:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Click the Windows button and search for <code>%appdata%</code>.</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>- Locate the file <strong>GameUserSettings.ini</strong> and open it.</p>
                            <p>- Find the line: <code>FrameRateLimit=</code></p>
                            <p>- If the value is <code>0.000000</code>, change it to match your monitor's frame rate.</p>
                            <p>- For example, if your monitor's refresh rate is <strong>144Hz</strong>, set it to:</p>
                            <p class="highlight-box"><code>FrameRateLimit=144.000000</code></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Adjust NVIDIA Control Panel Settings
                            <p>- If the above steps don’t work, open the <strong>NVIDIA Control Panel</strong>.</p>
                            <p>- Go to <strong>3D Settings</strong> and change the <strong>Shader Cache</strong> to <strong>Unlimited</strong>.</p>
                            <p>- Start the game and complete the initial setup (accepting terms, setting brightness, etc.).</p>
                            <p>- After the first launch, revert the <strong>Shader Cache</strong> setting to its previous value.</p>

                        <p>Many users have resolved this issue by using a performance mod from
                            <strong>NexusMods</strong>.
                            The mod helps optimize the game and get it working properly.

                        <h3><strong>Steps to Fix:</strong></h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Download a performance mod from <strong>NexusMods</strong>.</li>
                            <li>Extract and install it according to the mod’s instructions.</li>
                            <li>Restart your PC and launch the game.</li>

                    <strong>Solutions:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reinstall Visual C++ Redistributable
                            <p>- Reinstall VC_redist to restore missing dependencies that could cause the game to crash.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Verifying Integrity in Steam
                            <p>- Right click on game in Steam Library, go to Properties.
                                - Go to Installed Files, click on 'Verify integrity of game files' button.
                                - It will find corrupted files, which Steam should automatically re-download. After this
                                the game will start with no issues.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Check for Windows Updates
                            <p>- Ensure Windows is up to date to avoid compatibility issues introduced by recent system
                                updates.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Start a New Game and Load Past Save
                            <p>- If the game doesn’t start, try creating a new game and then loading your previous save.
                                This can help bypass crashes when starting directly.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Reinstall the Game
                            <p>- Uninstall and reinstall the game, especially if you're using Game Pass, to reset
                                corrupt installations.</p>
